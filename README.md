I created a questionnaire to study the questions that would be on the 'JÃ³venes a Programar' exams, with questions that had been asked before to practices with my classmates.
The program involves answering questions, and at the end of the section, it tells you which and how many you got wrong.
It also has a 'plus' feature that allows you to see the answers explained in detail to reinforce and review the concepts of the questions.
